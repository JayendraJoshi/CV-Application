## About This Project

This is a CV Application project built as part of my learning journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (React).

## What I Learned

This was my first React project. Through it, I learned when and where to define state, how to pass and manage props, and how to think in reusable "components". I learned a lot and I’m excited to keep using React to build larger web apps faster.
